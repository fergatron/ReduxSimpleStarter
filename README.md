# ReduxSimpleStarter

Interested in learning [Redux](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/)?

### Getting Started

This section (5) deals with creating a weather application that displays 5-day forecasts for searched cities. The results are persistent.

### Technologies introduced
* redux-promise (middleware)
* axios
* template strings (es6)
* react-sparkline - a great line chart tool.
* react-google-maps

### Notes
* **redux** always returns a new instance of state. Never manipulate state object directly.
